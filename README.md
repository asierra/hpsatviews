# High Performance Satellite Views

High performance satellite image processing and views generation for the GOES family.

It creates both a true color image for the day and a gray scale plus a meteorological colormap for the night and high clouds, a composite with both, and saves corresponding PNG images ready for fast, operational visualization. 

This version doesn't need L2 data, it uses L1b data directly.

External dependency: libnetcdf and libpng.
